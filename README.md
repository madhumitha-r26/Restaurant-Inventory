I have created a Restaurant Pantry Website.

Technologies used:
-- HTML - Website structure
-- CSS - Styling website
-- JavaScript - Logic behind the website
-- Bootstrap - To make the website responsive on all devices
-- Adobe Express - Editing Images
-- Font Awesome - Icons
-- Design Evo (online logo making application)- Favicon 

Functionalities of this website:
-- Search bar is used for searching items from the pantry list.
-- Number spinner is used to increment/ decrement the quantity of the item in the pantry list.
-- The 'Add Item' button adds the items and their quantity to the "MY CART" table.
-- The 'Delete button' is used to delete the item and its quantity to the "MY CART" table.
